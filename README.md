## Features

1. **Forward and Backward Diffusion**:
   - Simulates forward and backward diffusion processes for arbitrary datasets.
   - Supports customizable drift and diffusion coefficients.

2. **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fitting**:
   - Fits a GMM to multi-dimensional data or images.
   - Computes gradients of the log-probability density function for GMMs.
   - Efficient storage and retrieval of GMM models.

3. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Augments image datasets using rotations, flips, noise addition, and filtering.
   - Supports batch processing for large datasets.
